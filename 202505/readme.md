**Challenge:**
Macrophage Activation Syndrome

**Background**
Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a severe, potentially life-threatening condition involving a massive inflammatory response that overwhelms the whole body. 

Two pooled open-label studies with a new investigational drug aimed to reduce the dose of the current harmful standard therapy (GC).

**The challenge is to visualise:**
How effective was the new investigational drug in reducing GC doses over 8 weeks?
What proportion of subjects achieved GC doses between certain thresholds, and how did this change over time?
How much variability was there in GC doses, e.g. characterise shifts between threshold levels at the individual subject level?
