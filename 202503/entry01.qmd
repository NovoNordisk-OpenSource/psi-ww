## Key Messaging

### Efficacy Comparison (Left Panel)

- Drugs with data points further to the right are more effective compared to placebo.
- The spread of data points for each drug shows efficacy across different clinical assessments.
- Longer horizontal error bars indicate less certainty in the efficacy estimate.
- The purple arrow on the left indicates "Favors Placebo," while the green arrow on the right indicates "Favors Treatment."

### Risk Assessment (Middle Panel)

- Data points further to the right indicate higher toxicity risk.
- The difference in incidence rate per 100 patient-years provides a standardized measure of risk magnitude.
- Horizontal error bars show the uncertainty in the risk estimates.
- The green arrow on the left now indicates "Favors Treatment," while the purple arrow on the right indicates "Favors Placebo."

### Event Counts and Proportions (Right Panel)

- This panel shows the actual event counts and proportions for drug class toxicity.
- Purple dots represent placebo group data, while green dots represent active treatment group data.
- The proportions are visualized on a percentage scale for easy comparison.
- Actual event counts (n/N) are displayed next to each data point for precise information.

### Benefit-Risk Trade-off

- By comparing a drug's position across all three panels, one can assess its overall profile.
- Ideal drugs would be far right in the left panel (high efficacy), far left in the middle panel (low toxicity), and have lower proportions of events in the right panel.
- The uncertainty in both benefit and risk estimates should be considered when making comparisons.

### Comparative Analysis

- The alignment of drugs across all three panels allows for easy comparison between different drugs.
- It's possible to identify drugs that offer the best balance of high efficacy, low toxicity, and favorable event proportions.

### Decision Support

- This visualization supports informed decision-making in drug development and regulatory processes.
- It allows stakeholders to quickly grasp the overall benefit-risk profile of each drug in the portfolio, along with the actual event data.

### Uncertainty and Variability

- The error bars in the left and middle panels highlight the level of certainty in the efficacy and risk estimates.
- Different outcomes for the same drug in the efficacy panel show how efficacy can vary across different clinical assessments.
- The event counts in the right panel provide context for interpreting these uncertainties and variabilities.

### Standardized Comparison

- Using relative risk for efficacy, difference in incidence rate for risk, and actual proportions for events allows for a comprehensive and standardized comparison across drugs.
- The log scale for relative risk in the efficacy panel helps to visualize both small and large effects.

### Color Coding

- Consistent color coding across all three panels enhances interpretability:
  - Purple consistently represents placebo or outcomes favoring placebo.
  - Green consistently represents active treatment or outcomes favoring treatment.
- This color scheme helps in quickly identifying which group (placebo or active treatment) is favored in each aspect of the analysis.

### Comprehensive View

- The three-panel design provides a comprehensive view of drug performance:
  1. Efficacy compared to placebo
  2. Risk of toxicity
  3. Actual event counts and proportions
- This allows for a nuanced understanding of each drug's performance across multiple dimensions.
